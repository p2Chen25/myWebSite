<p>This man is Bill Nye The Science Guy. He was the guy on Bill Nye The Science guy where he did experiments and taught kids 
all around the world. He was born November 27, 1955 Washington D.C. He would later on go to Cornell University where he majored 
in mechanical engineering, and in 1993 Bill Nye The Science Guy aired and it was a hit. He also had a show Bill Nye Saves 
The World that aired in 2017 to 2018. 

<p>I chose Bill Nye because he was played a lot at school and it was one of the best things to watch during class. I also watched 
Bill Nye Saves The World, but I do not remember much about it. The only thing I remember from it was that in bathrooms when you wash 
your hands the ones with non touching despensers are way more hygenic than ones where you have to pull a nob or something like that.
